## Getting started

To use the Duffel API, you'll need to sign up for an account and then create an access token.

### Signing up

You can sign up for an account on the Duffel website - it takes about one minute.

Just head to <https://app.duffel.com/join> and enter your name, email address and password and you'll be good to go, with instant access to our sandbox.

### Creating your first access token

To create your access token, head to your [dashboard](https://app.duffel.com), click on your organisation name, then click "Developers", then "Access tokens", and then "New token".

Give your access token a name, and leave the scope as "Read write". Click the "Create token" button, and then you'll have your first token for our sandbox.

## Building your integration

### First steps

You'll find our API documentation  at <https://duffel.com/docs/api/overview/welcome>.

We'd recommend reading the ["Key Principles" section](https://duffel.com/docs/api/overview/key-principles) first to understand the most important concepts in our API.

### Searching for flights

To search for flights, you'll need to [create an offer request](https://duffel.com/docs/api/offer-requests/create-offer-request). 

An offer request describes the passengers and where and when they want to travel (in the form of a list of slices). It may also include additional filters (e.g. a particular cabin to travel in).

We'll send your search to a range of airlines, and return your offer request back to you with a series of offers.

Each offer represents a set of flights you can buy from an airline at a particular price that meet your search criteria.

Inside the offers, you'll see your slices, but now each slice will also include a list of one or more specific flights (called segments) that the airline is offering to get the passengers where they want to go.

### Creating an order 

Once you've found an offer that you want to book, you'll need to [create an order](https://duffel.com/docs/api/orders/create-order).

To do this, just pass in the ID of the offer you selected, some basic information about the passengers and your payment information. In our sandbox, you can pay using your Duffel Balance - it's unlimited ðŸŽ‰

## Experimenting with the API in Postman

We've created a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) collection to make it easy to get started with the API.

To start using it, open Postman, click "Import", then "Link", paste `` into the box and then click "Continue".
